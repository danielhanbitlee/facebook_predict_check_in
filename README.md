# facebook_predict_check_in
Using RStudio, my team and I analyzed the data set provided by Kaggle and Facebook. Facebook created an artificial world consisting of more than 100,000 places located on a 10 km by 10 km geographic square. The data simulates noisy location signals from mobile devices Facebook collects from its users. We conducted exploratory data analysis and discovered cyclic relationships between check-ins and time. We then used KNN and Neural Networks algorithms to predict check-ins.
